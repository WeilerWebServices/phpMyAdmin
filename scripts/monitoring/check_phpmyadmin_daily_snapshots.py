# I suggest creating a venv for this. I did it with `python3 -m venv daily_snapshot_venv` then source that with `source daily_snapshot_venv/bin/activate`.
# Install 'beautifulsoup4' to the venv

# This program checks that the phpMyAdmin daily downloads are within a day or two of the current time.
# We allow an extra day of wiggle room because of the possibility of working in different time zones.
