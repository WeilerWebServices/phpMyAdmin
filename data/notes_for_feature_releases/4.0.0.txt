Welcome to phpMyAdmin 4.0.0. With this version, the HTML frames are gone 
and the navigation panel now presents a tree. This version requires 
Javascript.

Version 4.0 contains many bug fixes and smaller new features; moreover,
the documentation has a new look and contains an index.

Details will appear on http://phpmyadmin.net. In a hurry? you can visit
https://sourceforge.net/projects/phpmyadmin/files to download.
