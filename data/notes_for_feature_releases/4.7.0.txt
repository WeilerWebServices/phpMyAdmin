Welcome to phpMyAdmin 4.7.0, a regular maintenance release containing new features, bug fixes, and a security fix.

A complete list of new features and bugs that have been fixed is available in the ChangeLog file or
changelog.php included with this release.

Notable changes since 4.6.6:
* Fix an issue where $cfg['Servers'][$i]['AllowNoPassword'] is ignored (PMASA-2017-8)
* Fix JavaScript errors when using Designer
* Show all databases in dropdown selector, including the current one
* Better defaults when creating a multi-field foreign key
* Improved support for TokuDB
* Improved handling of LoginCookieValidity, this should improve certain cases where users were getting logged out prematurely
* Fix an error that could occur when copying a database (related to pmadb/Configuration Storage metadata)
* Fixed OpenDocument exports
* Fixed alignment of NULL values
* Removed error message about client and server version mismatch
* Compatibility fixes when running under HHVM 3.18
* Fix the version check when curl is incorrectly configured
* Change the default export setting for Excel files; now the default is to include column names in the first row. This is always configurable with $cfg['Export']['excel_columns']
* Log failed authentication attempts to syslog (useful for parsing by fail2ban, for example)
* Add filtering for the database list
* Add table filtering to the database 'Structure' tab
* Add support for exporting user settings as a config.inc.php snippet
* Add option to delete settings from browser storage
* Changes to the JSON import and export format to better follow the JSON specification, however this breaks
  compatibility with older versions. See https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/import_export.html#json
* Support for IPv6 proxies
* Allow more connection parameters for the controluser connection
* Rename 'Relations' to 'Relationships' in many places as it's a more correct term
* More documentation for export configuration options
* Remove support for Swekey authentication
* Remove support for old, unsupported versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer
* Removed $cfg['ThemePath']

Starting with this version, phpMyAdmin uses Composer to manage PHP library dependencies while under development.
Users downloading the official source distribution will not notice a difference, however users of the git repository
should refer to https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/setup.html#installing-from-git for details.

Also beginning with this version, we've made some changes to the files available for download. There are now three
different packages available: `all-langauges` and `english` are the same downloads we've offered for some time, the former
featuring all languages for which we have a reasonable amount of translations and the latter being a smaller English-only
download. We have added a `source` download, which includes the unit test suite, Gettext po files, documentation source, and
JavaScript source files; these are omitted from the other packages as most users have no need for them. We have also reduced
the number of compression formats available due to low utilization; for each package we have .tar.gz, .tar.xz, and .zip formats
available.

There are many more improvements; please refer to the ChangeLog for full details.

As always, downloads are available at https://www.phpmyadmin.net
