    phpMyAdmin 2.8.0 - March 6, 2006

      A set of PHP-scripts to administrate MySQL over the Web.
      --------------------------------------------------------

    Announcement
    ------------

       The phpMyAdmin Project is proud to announce the immediate availability
       of phpMyAdmin 2.8.0.

       phpMyAdmin is a web administration tool for MySQL databases, intended to
       handle a whole database server as well as a single database. Over the years,
       it has become the most popular Web GUI for MySQL and is downloaded between 6,000
       and 14,000 times a day, according to SourceForge.net.

       The jump from 2.7.0 to 2.8.0 is partly because from now on, versions with the same
       X.Y number will have the same feature set, while the third number will be for bug
       fixes. Also, 2.8.0 has a new web-based setup script.

     * PHP 5.1.2 compatibility
     * Possibility to hide databases
     * Configurable memory limit for import/export

      (from http://www.phpmyadmin.net/documentation)

     * create, copy, rename, alter and drop databases
     * create, copy, rename, alter and drop tables
     * do table maintenance
     * add, edit and drop fields
     * execute any SQL-statement, even multiple queries
     * create, alter and drop indexes
     * load text files into tables
     * create (*) and read dumps of tables or databases
     * export (*) data to SQL, CSV, XML, Word, Excel, PDF and Latex forma=
ts
     * administer multiple servers
     * manage MySQL users and privileges
     * check server settings and runtime information with configuration hints
     * check referential integrity in MyISAM tables
     * using Query-by-example (QBE), create complex queries
automatically connecting required tables
     * create PDF graphics of your Database layout
     * search globally in a database or a subset of it
     * transform stored data into any format using a set of predefined
functions, like displaying BLOB-data as image or download-link
     * support InnoDB tables and foreign keys (see FAQ 3.6)
     * support mysqli, the improved MySQL extension (see FAQ 1.17)
