phpMyAdmin 2.6.0 - September 27th, 2004
=======================================

   A set of PHP-scripts to manage MySQL over the Web.
   --------------------------------------------------

Announcement
------------

    The phpMyAdmin Project is proud to announce the immediate availability of
    phpMyAdmin 2.6.0.

    Supporting the new improved MySQL extension of PHP5 (MySQLi), phpMyAdmin has
    made a giant step towards the new PHP version and the upcoming MySQL versions.

    phpMyAdmin has acquired a new CSS-based theme system. Two
    themes are included, and can be chosen from the main menu. Documentation
    is included (see FAQ 2.7) to create your own themes.

    phpMyAdmin is a web administration tool for MySQL databases, intended to
    handle a whole database server as well as a single database. Over the years,
    it has become the most popular GUI for MySQL and is downloaded about 6,000
    times a day, according to SourceForge.net.

    The highlights of this release in detail:
