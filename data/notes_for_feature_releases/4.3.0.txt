Welcome to phpMyAdmin 4.3. This release contains many bug fixes and several
new features including the work done by our Google Summer of Code (GSoC)
students, and is the first release since the hiring of a full-time
developer. Read on for more information or skip directly to the
download at https://sourceforge.net/projects/phpmyadmin/files or always read
the complete list of changes by referring to the changelog.php or ChangeLog
files, included with this release.

First, some information on our featured GSoC projects:

Smita Kumari worked on two structure tools,
1) “a feature that enables a user to maintain a central list of columns per database
to avoid similar name for the same data element and bring consistency of data
type for the same data element.”

2) Automated normalization is known as "Improve table structure" within phpMyAdmin.
It helps to bring the table structure upto Third Normal Form. A wizard is
presented to user which asks questions about the elements during the various
steps for normalization and a new structure is proposed accordingly to bring the
table optionally into the First/Second/Third Normal form.

Edward Cheng implemented a component which provides easy access to a console,
including bookmarking and a history viewer.

Chirayu Chiripal and Ashutosh Dhundhara both worked on many feature improvements.
These improvements may not be glamorous but feature some much needed maintenance
and minor improvements.

Behind the scenes, Dhananjay Nakrani has improved the error reporting server,
an optional reporting feature allowing users to automatically submit error
reports directly to the phpMyAdmin developers. Now, PHP errors can also be reported.

Additional behind the scenes work was done by Bimal Yashodha to refactor the code
behind the Designer interface. Most of these improvements are transparent to users
but help ease the maintenance  required on this portion of the code.

Our second piece of exciting news is that this release includes many improvements
thanks to our new full-time developer, Madhura Jayaratne.

"I am so excited to be working for phpMyAdmin as a contract developer and since
I started working, my focus has mainly been on stabilizing the code for the upcoming
version 4.3 release. This involved fixing a number of bugs as well as improving
performance, which was due for some time.”

The biggest improvement Madhura has brought to 4.3 is increased speed and performance
when operating with many (thousands) databases, such as in a shared hosting environment.

* Smart sorting for int keys
