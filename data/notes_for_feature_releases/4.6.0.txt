Welcome to phpMyAdmin 4.6.0, a regular maintenance release including over 35 improvements.
Please note that this release ends support for old versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer,
which are no longer supported by Microsoft. There is a new configuration directive, $cfg['Servers'][$i]['ssl_verify']
which is useful in some cases with self-signed certificates. The ForceSSL and PmaAbsoluteUri configuration
directives have been removed (the functions of both of these should better be handled by the webserver
than the application).

A complete list of new features and bugs that have been fixed is available in the ChangeLog file or
changelog.php included with this release.

A few highlights:
* Allow setting routine-wise privileges
* UI for defining partitioning in create table window
* Support JSON data type
* Editing partitions in table Structure
* Copy results to clipboard
* Reactivate cut&paste possibility in print view
* Display binary strings as text if they are valid UTF-8
* Copy multiple tables to database
* Show MySQL error messages in user language

There are many more improvements; please refer to the ChangeLog for full details.
