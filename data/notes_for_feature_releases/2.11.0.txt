phpMyAdmin 2.11.0 - August 21, 2007
===================================

A set of PHP-scripts to administrate MySQL over the Web.
--------------------------------------------------------

Announcement
------------

The phpMyAdmin Project is proud to announce the immediate availability
of phpMyAdmin 2.11.0, which will probably be the last series supporting 
PHP 4.

This version supports creating VIEWs from query results
and can manage triggers, procedures and functions. It also supports
MySQL 5.0.37 query profiling and has an improved interface for servers
hosting thousands of databases and tables.

phpMyAdmin is a web administration tool for MySQL databases, intended to
handle a whole database server as well as a single database. Over the
years, it has become the most popular Web GUI for MySQL.

* check referential integrity in MyISAM tables
* using Query-by-example (QBE), create complex queries automatically
    connecting required tables
* create PDF graphics of your Database layout
* search globally in a database or a subset of it
* transform stored data into any format using a set of predefined functions,
    like displaying BLOB-data as image or download-link
