       it has become the most popular Web GUI for MySQL and is downloaded between 6,000
       and 14,000 times a day, according to SourceForge.net.

     * Configuration files coming from before phpMyAdmin 2.3.0 (released
on 2002-08-11)
       are no longer supported.
     * You can still use your config.inc.php file, but this file can be
